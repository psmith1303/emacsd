# My EMACS configuration

This is my emacs configuration. It uses an init file to load up `psmith.org`, which it then untangles all of the code blocks to `psmith.el` and then runs that code.

The ideas in these files were taken from many locations and folk, including [Sasha Chua](http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html).
